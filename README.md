To generate calculations of thermodynamic quantities and speed limit bounds, open the command line, navigate to the directory in which you downloaded all the files, and execute the python file "LRM_calc.py" (e.g., with "py LRM_calc.py" or "py3 LRM_calc.py", depending on the configuration of Python on your system), having made the appropriate changes to the code to print or log in a file the quantities of your interest.

To generate graphs of the bounds or of other quantities, follow all the same above steps but instead run the file "LRM_vis.py". 

All functions are created in a "tools_[forsomething].py" file and used in "LRM_[forsomething].py" file.
